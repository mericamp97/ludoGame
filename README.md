# Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project automates the classic game of Ludo, playing out the game with simplified rules and displaying the outcomes textually. It demonstrates the game mechanics through an automated simulation.

# Simplified Rules
- **Single Piece per Player:** Each player is represented by only one piece instead of the traditional four, streamlining the game's complexity and decision-making.
- **Automated Gameplay:** The game is entirely played by the computer, showcasing a complete game cycle without player interaction.

# Features
- **Text-based Simulation:** Each move and its outcome are printed, offering a turn-by-turn narration of the game.

# How to Use
- Run the notebook to start the simulation.
- Watch the game progress through the printed text for each turn.
- You can use this code to understand game patterns.
